### What's Inside
- **Unified aesthetics** - Dynamically assigned color schemes generated by **Py-Wal**
- **Wallpaper collection** - A collection of high-resolution wallpapers that generate appealing color schemes
- **Minimalist Design** - This **Hyprland** + **Waybar** setup was specifically designed to be minimal without sacrificing functionality
- **Extensive Documentation** - Step-by-step guides with explanations and examples to provide a deep understanding, ensuring that further customization can be done with ease

### How It Works
After running **Py-Wal** using the `wal -i "/path/to/wallpaper.ext"` command, or changing your wallpaper with software supporting a *post-command* such as **waypaper**, a singular color pallet is dynamically created, and a plethora of style files are generated in `~/.cache/wal/`, those themes are then referenced in various sub-folders within `~/.config/` using symbolic links. After enabling the custom theme within an application, the application will have an appealing color scheme that matches your wallpaper. With the necessary configuration and unique personal customization, all applications will update their theme on wallpaper change.

### How To Install
It is highly recommended to follow the [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md) for step-by-step setup and troubleshooting. Please read all instructions and have an understanding of commands before executing them on your machine to prevent possible damage.
